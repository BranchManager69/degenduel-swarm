# 🎲 DegenDuel: Strategic Crypto Portfolio Competition

## 🚀 What is DegenDuel?

**DegenDuel** is a unique, strategy-based crypto competition platform built around real-time **Solana token** performance tracking. Players compete by building virtual portfolios and managing strategic alliances, betrayals, and eliminations—drawing inspiration from reality shows like **"Survivor."**

## ⚙️ How Does DegenDuel Work?

### 📌 Step 1: Joining a Contest

- **Entry Fees**: Players enter contests by paying a set entry fee in **Solana (SOL)**.
- **Portfolio Selection**: Before contests start, players strategically allocate their portfolios from eligible Solana-based tokens, anticipating real-time market movements.
- **AI Player-Agent Avatars**: Each contestant selects an AI-driven agent avatar representing them, autonomously managing strategic gameplay. Users can optionally override the agent to directly influence gameplay.

### 📌 Step 2: Gameplay Mechanics

#### 📊 Portfolio Performance
- Real-time crypto price tracking dynamically affects player rankings, visible via intuitive leaderboards.

#### 🗣️ Strategic Social Gameplay (Survivor-Inspired)
- Regular voting rounds ("Tribal Councils") occur, where each contestant votes to eliminate another contestant based on strategic gameplay, alliances, or perceived threats.
- Even top-performing portfolios are vulnerable without strategic alliances or immunity, significantly enhancing game complexity and intrigue.

### 📌 Step 3: Immunity & Strategic Safety

- Players can achieve temporary immunity through strategic portfolio accomplishments or specific in-game events, safeguarding them during critical voting rounds.

### 📌 Step 4: AI Game Master

- An authoritative **AI Game Master** oversees each contest:
  - Provides neutral, tactical announcements and insights about in-game events (alliances, betrayals, market shifts).
  - Facilitates voting and eliminations, silencing eliminated contestants temporarily.
  - Offers detailed end-of-game commentary, candidly evaluating players' strategic decisions.

### 📌 Step 5: Elimination & Endgame

- Players are progressively eliminated through strategic voting until a single winner remains.
- Eliminated contestants observe silently until invited back for brief end-of-game reflections.
- The contest concludes with a comprehensive strategic analysis provided by the AI Game Master, clearly summarizing alliances, betrayals, and key strategic moves.
